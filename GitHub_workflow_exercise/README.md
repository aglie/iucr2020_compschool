Exercise to practice the GitHub "numpy" workflow
================================================
Your goal is to get a "Pull Request" merged into the iucr2020_compschool repo (i.e., here)

1. fork this repo
1. clone your fork
1. synchronize your clone ("git checkout main" followed by "git pull upstream main")
1. create a new branch with a new name
1. now the edits.   
    1. in the GitHub_workflow_exercise/names directory, create a new text file called <your_name>.txt
    1. in that file write your first and last name
    1. add and commit it to your local Git database
    1. push it to a branch of the same name on your fork
    1. create a pull request to the main repo
1. keep checking back to see if there are any comments from reviewers
1. attend to the comments and then add, commit and push to update the PR
1. repeat until the PR gets merged
1. you are done

Extra credit:
1. in the src directory contribute to the code that will make a program that will
   read all the files in the names directory and ranomly pick two names to greet each
   other by printing 
   "Hello, my name is <name1>, what is your name?
   "Hello <name1>, my name is <name2>.  How are you enjoying this course"
   "I am loving it, but I wish the conference was in <place1> and we could all be there"
2. one job is to create issues that need to be solved for this program to work, so create them!
3. if this is done, pick an issue and assign it to yourself by writing a comment on the issue, something like "@mygithubusername will take this"
4. use the GitHub workflow to make a PR that implements your contribution.  If you  get done then help others to do their contributions so there is work for, and learning by, everyone.
